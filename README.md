I am not in the direction of computer vision myself. The reason for doing this project is that one day I was surprised to find that Yolo computer vision course popped up when I searched the song Y.O.L.O.

P. S. Seriously suspects that yolo is a labor-intensive work, which is too tiring, and will not do yolo related projects in the future
